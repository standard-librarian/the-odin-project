        <ol>
          <li>
            Rinse the rice and lentils separately under cold water until the
            water runs clear. Then, cook the rice and lentils separately
            according to their package instructions until they are both fully
            cooked. Add a pinch of salt to each while cooking for flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until it is al
            dente. Drain and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large skillet or saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
            over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute
            until fragrant. Be careful not to let it burn. Then, add the tomato
            sauce, season with salt and pepper, and simmer on low heat for about
            10 minutes to let the flavors meld.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate small saucepan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of
            vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced onions and
            cook, stirring frequently, until they turn golden brown and crispy.
            Remove the onions from the oil and set them aside on a plate lined
            with a paper towel to drain excess oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, mix the white vinegar with the minced garlic to
            create the garlic vinegar sauce. Set it aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            To assemble the koshari, start by layering the cooked rice, followed
            by the cooked lentils, pasta, and boiled chickpeas in a large
            serving dish or individual bowls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generously drizzle the tomato sauce over the top of the layered
            ingredients, making sure to coat them well.
